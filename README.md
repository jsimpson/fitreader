# FitReader

### This is a work in progress

This is a JavaScript/Deno library that is largely a port of the Ruby [fitreader](https://github.com/richardbrodie/fitreader) library. It is capable of parsing and decoding .FIT files, which are a binary data format used by GPS devices and various sensors.

It has a very small API footprint, exposing a single class which is capable of handling all of the processing.
